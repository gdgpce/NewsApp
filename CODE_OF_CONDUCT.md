# Code of Conduct for Google Developer Groups On Campus - Pillai College of Engineering, New Panvel

## Introduction

We are committed to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all members of our community. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participant behavior, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the community leaders may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from the community and its events without warning.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subjected to or notice unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting us at [gdscpce@mes.ac.in]. We will review all reports and take appropriate action.

## Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the community leaders with a concise description of your grievance.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within community spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the community. It also applies to social events held by the community.
